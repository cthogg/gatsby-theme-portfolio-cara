# Gatsby Portfolio Cara Theme

Gatsby theme adapted from the beautiful [Cara](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara) starter. 

## Features

- Write a simple portfolio site from just one markdown file

## Out of Scope

- Ability to blog - hopefully another theme can manage the blogging part of the site later.

## Installation

1. On a new repo install gatsby and this theme `yarn add gatsby gatsby-theme-portfolio-cara -D`
1. Create a`gatsby-config.js` file in the root
1. Set the `gatsby-theme-portfolio-cara` in the `__experimentalThemes` option inside your `gatsby-config.js` 

```js
module.exports = {
  __experimentalThemes: [    {
    resolve: "gatsby-theme-portfolio-cara" ,
    NOTREADY_options: {
      siteTitle: `Your site title`,
      siteDescription: `Here is a site title`,
    }
  },]
}
```
1. Create directory `src/pages/markdown` `mkdir -p src/pages/markdown`
1. Create `index.md` in `src/pages/markdown` and add the following to it

```markdown
---
title: "Hello"
subtitle: "I'm creating nice web experiences for the next generation of consumer-facing companies"
email: 'hi@hi.com'
aboutDesc: "The English language can not fully capture the depth and complexity of my thoughts. So I'm incorporating Emoji into my speech to better express myself. Winky face."
aboutSub: "You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands? That's how you're gonna feel every day. My mother cried the day I was born because she knew sheâ€™d never be prettier than me. You should make me your campaign manager. I was born for politics. I have great hair and I love lying. Captain? The kids want to know where Paulie the Pigeon is. I told them he got sucked up into an airplane engine, is that all right?"
projectOneTitle : "Freiheit"        
projectOneUrl   :   "https://www.behance.net/gallery/58937147/Freiheit"                        
projectOneDesc  :  "This project is my entry to Adobe's #ChallengeYourPerspective contest."                
projectTwoTitle  : "Project 2"     
projectTwoUrl   :   "https://github.com/cthogg/gatsby-theme-portfolio-cara"
projectTwoDesc   :  "Description of project 2"   
projectThreeTitle  : "Project 3"      
projectThreeUrl   :   "https://github.com/cthogg/gatsby-theme-portfolio-cara"
projectThreeDesc  :  "Description of project 3" 
projectFourTitle  : "Project 4"     
projectFourDesc   :   "Description of project 4"
projectFourUrl    :  "https://github.com/cthogg/gatsby-theme-portfolio-cara"

Stub page.

```
1. Add `.cache` and `public` to the repo's `.gitignore` file

1. Run with `yarn gatsby develop`  

1. Edit the page's content from `src/pages/markdown/index.md` to edit the website.

1. Want to change something? Take advantage of Gatsby's [component shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/) by creating a copy of the component you want to modify and editing that.

## Roadmap:

- change the site's ui with simple theming.
- instructions to deploy to Netlify
- put the config file as a theme option
- integration with one of the many CMSs from the list at [the power of serverless](https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/cmss/)
- Add a license.
- Compare to modern-portfolio to make a template for themes so can easily switch between themes (probably best to put the questions object in [commander-pages](https://github.com/cthogg/commander-pages) in the theme repo for added extensibility) 

## Inspiration:
-  https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara for the starter template.
